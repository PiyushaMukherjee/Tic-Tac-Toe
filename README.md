# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game designed for two players, traditionally played on a grid of 3x3 squares.
Each player takes turns marking a square with their respective symbol, usually "X" for one player and "O" for the other, with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

This frontend implementation of Tic Tac Toe provides an intuitive user interface where players can click on squares to place their symbols. The game tracks each move, checks for a winner after each turn, and declares the winner or a draw accordingly. With its simple yet engaging design, this frontend Tic Tac Toe game offers a fun and interactive experience for players of all ages.
